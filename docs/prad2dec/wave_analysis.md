# Software Waveform Analysis in `prad2dec`

`prad2dec` ships **two** offline analyzers that run on raw FADC250 samples
(`uint16_t[nsamples]`, 4 ns/sample at 250 MHz):

| Analyzer | Class | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Waveform | `fdec::WaveAnalyzer` (`WaveAnalyzer.{h,cpp}`) | Robust local-maxima peak finding for HyCal energy / time use. Tolerates noisy pedestals, finds multiple peaks per channel. |
| Firmware emulator | `fdec::Fadc250FwAnalyzer` (`Fadc250FwAnalyzer.{h,cpp}`) | Bit-faithful emulation of the JLab FADC250 firmware Mode 1/2/3 (Hall-D V3 + NSAT/NPED/MAXPED extensions). Used to compare offline reconstruction against on-board firmware output. |

Both are stack-allocated, zero-heap on the hot path, and run side-by-side
when `prad2ana_replay_rawdata` is invoked with the `-p` flag (see
[`docs/REPLAYED_DATA.md`](../REPLAYED_DATA.md)).

The remainder of this note walks through both algorithms on a single
example pulse, with parameter values matching the real run config in
[`database/daq_config.json`](../../database/daq_config.json).

## Example waveform

100 samples × 4 ns. A short, bright pulse on top of a quiet ~146 ADC
baseline, followed by a long scintillation tail.

![overview](figs/fig1_overview.png)

| feature | value |
|---|---|
| length | 100 samples = 400 ns |
| baseline | ≈ 146 ADC (samples 0..29) |
| pulse onset | sample 30 (t = 120 ns) |
| peak | sample 32, 1393 ADC |
| rise time | 8 ns (cross → peak) |
| tail | slow exponential decay, still ~20 ADC above baseline at sample 99 |

This is representative of a HyCal PbWO₄ signal: a fast leading edge
(~10 ns) followed by a long PMT/scintillator tail.

## Waveform analyzer — `WaveAnalyzer`

Used for HyCal calibration / monitoring where we want a robust peak
height and a generous integral that follows the actual pulse shape rather
than a fixed firmware window.

### Parameters

All settings live in `fdec::WaveConfig` (see `WaveAnalyzer.h`); the values
shown are the defaults.

| field | default | unit | role |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `resolution`     |   2 | half-width | Triangular smoothing kernel half-width. `1` disables smoothing. Larger values smear the rising edge but suppress per-sample noise. |
| `threshold`      | 5.0 | × pedestal RMS | Peak-acceptance threshold above the local baseline. |
| `min_threshold`  | 3.0 | ADC counts | Hard floor on the acceptance threshold — protects quiet channels where `5·rms` would underflow. |
| `min_peak_ratio` | 0.3 | fraction | When two peaks overlap, the secondary must be ≥ this fraction of the primary's height to survive. |
| `int_tail_ratio` | 0.1 | fraction | Integration stops when the pedsub waveform drops below `r × peak height`. Smaller values capture more of the tail. |
| `ped_nsamples`   |  30 | samples | Window used for the pedestal estimate (start of the buffer). |
| `ped_flatness`   | 1.0 | ADC counts | Floor on the outlier-rejection band: samples are kept iff `|s − μ| < max(rms, ped_flatness)`. Prevents over-tight clipping on already-quiet baselines. |
| `ped_max_iter`   |   3 | iterations | Maximum outlier-rejection passes. Stops early if the mask doesn't change or fewer than 5 samples remain. |
| `overflow`       | 4095 | ADC counts | 12-bit overflow value — peaks at this height are tagged. |
| `clk_mhz`        | 250.0 | MHz | Sample rate for the time conversion `t_ns = pos · 1000 / clk_mhz`. |

### Pipeline

**1. Triangular smoothing.** `resolution = 2` (default) →
`buf[i] = (raw[i−1]·w + raw[i] + raw[i+1]·w) / (1 + 2w)` with
`w = 1 − 1/(res+1)`. With `res = 1` smoothing is disabled.

**2. Iterative pedestal (median/MAD bootstrap).** First `ped_nsamples = 30`
samples of the *smoothed* trace.

- Seed `mean` with the **median** and `rms` with **MAD × 1.4826** of the
  window (robust against ≤50 % contamination — a previous-event tail or
  early ringing biases a simple-mean seed badly, loosens the σ-clip band,
  and the iteration can converge on a contaminated baseline).
- Iterate up to `ped_max_iter = 3` times: drop samples deviating more
  than `max(rms, ped_flatness)` from the mean, then re-compute mean/rms
  on the survivors.
- Track `nused` (surviving sample count) and a `Q_PED_*` quality bitmask
  (see [§ Pedestal quality](#pedestal-quality) below).
- Compute a least-squares `slope` (ADC/sample) on the survivors — catches
  baseline drift that the σ-clip alone hides.

For our trace: `mean = 145.61`, `rms = 0.45`, `nused = 26`, `slope ≈ 0`,
`quality = Q_PED_GOOD` after convergence.

**2b. Adaptive window.** If the leading window looks suspicious
(`Q_PED_NOT_CONVERGED`, `Q_PED_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES`, `Q_PED_OVERFLOW`, or
`nused < ped_nsamples / 2`) and the waveform is long enough that the
last `ped_nsamples` samples don't overlap the leading window
(`nsamples ≥ 2 · ped_nsamples`), the analyzer also estimates the
pedestal on the trailing samples and uses whichever has the lower RMS
(with `nused` as the tiebreaker).  When the trailing estimate wins,
`Q_PED_TRAILING_WINDOW` is set.

**3. Threshold.** `thr = max(threshold·rms, min_threshold)` =
`max(5·0.45, 3.0) = 3.0`. The hard floor `min_threshold` keeps the
threshold sane on quiet channels.

**4. Local-maxima search.** Walk smoothed buffer; a peak is accepted iff:

- it is a local max (with flat-plateau handling)
- its height above the **local baseline** (linear interpolation between
  the surrounding minima) exceeds `thr`
- its height above the **pedestal mean** exceeds both `thr` and `3·rms`

**5. Integration.** Walk outward from the peak, summing pedsub values
until `s′ < tail_cut = int_tail_ratio · ped_height` (default 10 % of peak
height) or `s′ < ped_rms`. This adapts to the pulse shape — wide pulses
get wide windows, narrow pulses get narrow ones.

**6. Raw-position correction.** The recorded `pos` is the raw-sample
maximum near the smoothed peak (not the smoothed peak itself), so the
reported height equals the actual ADC at the peak rather than a smoothed
under-estimate.

For our trace:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `peak.pos` | sample 32 (t = 128.0 ns) |
| `peak.height` | 1247 ADC (raw − pedestal) |
| `peak.left, peak.right` | 28, 49 (integration bounds) |
| `peak.integral` | 9600 (ADC·sample, pedsub) |

### Pedestal quality

The analyzer reports four scalars per channel that together describe how
trustworthy the pedestal estimate is — written to the `events` tree as
`hycal.ped_{mean,rms,nused,quality,slope}` (see
[`docs/REPLAYED_DATA.md`](../REPLAYED_DATA.md)):

| Field | Type | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ped_mean`    | `float` | Pedestal mean after rejection |
| `ped_rms`     | `float` | RMS after rejection |
| `ped_nused`   | `uint8` | # samples that survived (compare to `ped_nsamples = 30`) |
| `ped_slope`   | `float` | LSQ drift (ADC/sample) on the survivors — non-zero suggests baseline tilt or pulse-tail contamination |
| `ped_quality` | `uint8` | `Q_PED_*` bitmask, see below |

Quality flags (defined in `prad2dec/include/Fadc250Data.h`):

| Bit | Flag | Set when |
|---|---|---|
| `0`     | `Q_PED_GOOD`             | clean estimate, no flags |
| `1<<0`  | `Q_PED_NOT_CONVERGED`    | `ped_max_iter` exhausted, kept-mask still moving |
| `1<<1`  | `Q_PED_FLOOR_ACTIVE`     | `rms < ped_flatness` — `ped_flatness` was the active band (typical for very quiet channels; informational) |
| `1<<2`  | `Q_PED_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES`  | < 5 samples survived rejection (rejection aborted) |
| `1<<3`  | `Q_PED_PULSE_IN_WINDOW`  | `findPeaks` returned a peak with `pos` inside the pedestal window we used |
| `1<<4`  | `Q_PED_OVERFLOW`         | a raw window sample hit `cfg.overflow` (4095) |
| `1<<5`  | `Q_PED_TRAILING_WINDOW`  | adaptive logic chose the trailing window over the leading one (informational, not a problem flag) |

A clean-event filter is `ped_quality == 0`.  For analyses that care
about the pedestal stability rather than the peak heights, cutting on
`Q_PED_NOT_CONVERGED | Q_PED_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES | Q_PED_PULSE_IN_WINDOW`
removes the events where the iterative cut couldn't settle on a clean
baseline.

### Parameter sensitivity

Two of the parameters above visibly change the analyzer's output on this
trace:

![params](figs/fig4_soft_parameters.png)

**Left — pedestal `ped_flatness` × `ped_max_iter`.** All 30 baseline
samples enter pass 1; samples deviating from the running mean by more
than `max(rms, ped_flatness) = 1.0` are dropped, the mean and rms are
recomputed, and the procedure repeats. After convergence the band has
collapsed onto the dominant cluster (146 / 147 ADC) and the outliers
(values 143 / 144 / 145 / 150) are off the kept set. `ped_flatness` sets
the noise floor below which the band stops shrinking — without it, a
particularly quiet channel could iterate down to a band of zero width and
reject everything except the modal value.

> Note: the demo runs the procedure on the *raw* samples for readability
> (integer values plot cleanly); the C++ runs it on the smoothed buffer,
> which is why the converged mean shown here (146.50) is slightly higher
> than the analyzer's reported value (145.61). The kept/rejected pattern
> is the same in both cases.

**Right — `int_tail_ratio`.** The integration walks outward from the
peak and stops when the pedsub waveform falls below `r × peak height`.
For this slow tail:

| `int_tail_ratio` | window | samples | integral |
|---:|:---:|---:|---:|
| 0.20 | [30, 41] | 12 | 8376 |
| 0.10 (default) | [30, 47] | 18 | 9477 |
| 0.05 | [30, 57] | 28 | 10332 |

The default of 0.10 is a good compromise: it captures the prompt peak
plus the first ~70 ns of the tail, missing only the slow scintillation
component (which is also where pile-up from the next event lives).
Smaller `r` recovers more tail energy but increases sensitivity to
baseline drift and downstream pulses.

**Smoothing — `resolution`.** On the bright pulse above, smoothing is
invisible at the scale of a 1247 ADC peak. It earns its keep on
small-signal channels where the per-sample fluctuation is comparable to
the pulse height. The figure below uses a different waveform — a small
~24 ADC bump on a baseline with ±3 ADC zig-zag — to show what the kernel
does:

![smoothing](figs/fig5_smoothing.png)

| `resolution` | spurious local maxima above +2 ADC | peak height (smoothed) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (raw) | 6 | 169 |
| 2 (default) | 3 | 166 |
| 4 | 1 | 162 |

`res = 1` keeps the raw zig-zag — six local maxima clear +2 ADC, the
peak finder needs every other rejection rule (height-above-baseline,
3·rms, peak-overlap ratio) to find the real one. `res = 2` collapses the
zig-zag without visibly attenuating the pulse. `res = 4` removes
essentially all baseline structure but starts to clip the peak by ~7
ADC, so its use should be reserved for very low-S/N channels where
peak-finding robustness is worth more than peak-height fidelity.

The remaining parameters affect the bright-pulse example only
marginally:

- `threshold = 5` × the post-clipping rms (0.45) gives 2.25 ADC, below
  the floor; `min_threshold = 3` wins. For a noisier channel with rms
  ≳ 1 ADC the `5·rms` rule kicks in.
- `min_peak_ratio` only matters when two peaks share an integration
  range — single-pulse waveforms never trigger it.

## Firmware emulator — `Fadc250FwAnalyzer`

The firmware analyzer reproduces the on-board pipeline so we can compare
offline analysis against firmware-reported values without re-running the
DAQ. The full algorithm spec lives in
[`docs/clas_fadc/FADC250_algorithms.md`](../clas_fadc/FADC250_algorithms.md);
this section is a parameter-by-parameter walk-through.

### Parameters

Parameters live under the `fadc250_firmware` block in `daq_config.json`.
**`NSB` and `NSA` are in nanoseconds**, floored to whole 4 ns samples
inside the analyzer; everything else is unitless or in ADC counts.

| field | unit | role |
|---|---|---|
| `TET` | ADC counts | Trigger Energy Threshold above pedestal. A pulse is rejected if `Vpeak − Vmin ≤ TET`. |
| `NSB` | ns | Window before threshold crossing (Mode 2 integral). Floored to whole samples (`NSB / CLK_NS`). |
| `NSA` | ns | Window after threshold crossing. Same flooring as `NSB`. |
| `NPEAK` (= `MAX_PULSES`) | — | Max pulses kept per channel per readout window (1..4). |
| `NSAT` | samples | Consecutive-above-TET requirement after Tcross — rejects single-sample spikes. `NSAT=1` reproduces the legacy Mode 3 single-sample crossing. |
| `NPED` | samples | Number of leading samples summed for the `Vnoise` estimate. |
| `MAXPED` | ADC counts | Online outlier-rejection threshold: pedsub samples whose deviation exceeds `MAXPED` are dropped from the `Vnoise` sum. `0` disables. |
| `CLK_NS` | ns | Sample period (4 ns at 250 MHz). |

Run-config defaults (current `daq_config.json`):

```json
"TET": 10.0, "NSB": 8, "NSA": 128, "NPEAK": 1,
"NSAT": 4, "NPED": 3, "MAXPED": 1, "CLK_NS": 4.0
```

### Pipeline

Step-by-step, applied to the example waveform:

**1. Pedestal estimate (`Vnoise`).** Mean of the first `NPED = 3` samples
with `MAXPED = 1` outlier filter (drop any sample whose deviation from the
running mean exceeds 1 ADC). For our trace: `(146+147+144)/3 = 145.67`,
sample 1 (147) is filtered, refined mean = `145.0`.

**2. Pulse search.** `Vmin = Vnoise`. Walk the buffer starting at sample
`NPED`. The first pulse is detected as soon as a sample exceeds `Vnoise`
and walks monotonically up to a local maximum.

**3. Acceptance.** `Vpeak = 1393`. The pedestal-subtracted height is
`Vpeak − Vmin = 1247 ≫ TET = 10` → accepted.

**4. Tcross.** First leading-edge sample whose pedsub value exceeds `TET`:
sample 30, since `637 − 146 = 491 > 10`.

**5. NSAT gate.** `NSAT = 4` → samples 30, 31, 32, 33 must all be > TET.
They are (491, 1221, 1247, 1093) → accepted. With `NSAT = 1`, this gate is
a no-op.

**6. TDC — `Va`, bracket, fine time.**

```
Va  = Vmin + (Vpeak − Vmin) / 2
    = 146 + (1393 − 146) / 2
    = 769.5
```

Find the bracket on the rising edge: smallest `k` with `s[k] ≥ Va`. Here
`s[30] = 637 < 769.5`, `s[31] = 1367 ≥ 769.5` → `k = 31`. So
`Vba = s[30] = 637`, `Vaa = s[31] = 1367`. Fine time:

```
fine = round( (Va − Vba) / (Vaa − Vba) × 64 )
     = round( (769.5 − 637) / (1367 − 637) × 64 )
     = round( 0.1815 × 64 ) = 12

coarse     = k − 1 = 30
time_units = coarse·64 + fine = 1932    (LSB = 62.5 ps)
time_ns    = time_units × CLK_NS / 64 = 120.75 ns
```

Visually (`fig2`, left panel): the dot-dash `Va` line crosses the rising
edge between the diamond `Vba` and the square `Vaa` markers. The fine-time
arrow points from the `Vba` sample to the interpolated zero-crossing.

**7. Mode-2 integral.** Window `[cross − NSB_s, cross + NSA_s]` where
`NSB_s = NSB/4 = 2`, `NSA_s = NSA/4 = 32`. So `[28, 62]`, i.e. 35 samples
= 140 ns. The integrand is the pedestal-subtracted waveform `s′ = max(0,
s − Vnoise)`.

```
Σ s′[28..62] = 10589  (pedsub ADC·sample)
```

The shaded band in `fig2` (right panel) is exactly this sum.

![firmware](figs/fig2_firmware_analysis.png)

**8. Quality bitmask.** `0x00` = `Q_DAQ_GOOD`. Set bits would indicate:

| bit | flag | condition |
|---|---|---|
| `1 << 0` | `Q_DAQ_PEAK_AT_BOUNDARY` | peak landed on the last sample |
| `1 << 1` | `Q_DAQ_NSB_TRUNCATED`   | `cross − NSB_s < 0`, window clipped |
| `1 << 2` | `Q_DAQ_NSA_TRUNCATED`   | `cross + NSA_s ≥ N`, window clipped |
| `1 << 3` | `Q_DAQ_VA_OUT_OF_RANGE` | `Va` not bracketed on the rising edge (numerical edge case) |

## Side-by-side comparison

| field | waveform (`WaveAnalyzer`) | firmware (`Fadc250FwAnalyzer`) |
|---|---|---|
| pedestal | 145.61 ± 0.45 (30 samples, σ-clip) | 145.0 (3 samples, MAXPED filter) |
| time | 128.0 ns (raw peak sample × 4) | 120.75 ns (TDC mid-amplitude interp.) |
| height | 1247 ADC (raw − ped) | 1247 ADC (`Vpeak − Vmin`) |
| integral window | [28, 49] (22 samples, tail-driven) | [28, 62] (35 samples, fixed NSB/NSA) |
| integral | 9600 | 10589 |

The waveform analyzer's *time* is the peak sample (rounded to 4 ns); the
firmware's *time* is mid-amplitude on the rising edge with 62.5 ps LSB —
they are intentionally different observables.

The firmware's wider window (140 ns vs the waveform analyzer's 88 ns)
picks up more of the slow scintillation tail. With `NSA = 128 ns` the
window stops at sample 62; the rest of the tail (samples 63..99) is
excluded.

## Reproducing the plots

Both algorithms are re-implemented in
[`plot_wave_analysis.py`](plot_wave_analysis.py) (NumPy + Matplotlib only).

```bash
cd docs/prad2dec
python plot_wave_analysis.py
```

Regenerates `figs/fig1_overview.png`, `figs/fig2_firmware_analysis.png`,
`figs/fig3_soft_analysis.png`, `figs/fig4_soft_parameters.png`,
`figs/fig5_smoothing.png` and prints the numeric results above.
